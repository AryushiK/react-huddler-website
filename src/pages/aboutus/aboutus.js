                    <p className="why-description">
                        At Huddler, we believe money is more than just numbers. It's hope, security, and the power to shape your future.
                        But too often, the path to building wealth feels isolating, slow, and overwhelming. No one thrives alone, not in life and not when it comes to money.
                        <br /><br />
                        That's why we're building a community where financial growth is shared, knowledge flows freely, and people move faster and go further by moving together.
                        A place where it's okay not to know everything, and where vulnerability is met with support, not judgment.
                        <br /><br />
                        Because when we do it together, building wealth becomes less daunting and much more possible.
